    <h2> Evaluation of this piece </h2> 
    <p>I feel... lost. When we were supposed to do this I was struggling a lot creatively and mentally, and I just couldn't focus on this, or anything really.</p>
    <h3> Character </h3>
    <p>I enjoyed making Caramel. He was really fun to write, and I really liked giving him this BIG personality. </p>
    <h3> Setting </h3>
    <p> Man oh MAN I am sad. I never really got to expand it as much as I wanted to. I did the scene with the stalls, but I didn't really get to do the scene with the town as a whole. I was going to have Jix and Milk sit on a cliff and look down on the town and reflect and character build with each other and just... MAN. I really want to keep writing this now! <br> sadly don't have the time...</p>
    <h3> Structure </h3>
    <p> lmao what</p>
