	    <h3> Dicton </h3>
        <p> I feel that my diction needs work. <br> In general. I struggle constantly with finding the right words for the right thing, and I feel as though no matter what I put it would always be empty. <br> For my Senior year I had to rely ENTIRELY on grammar for the effect I wanted. Is that okay? <br> I think it is!<p>
	    <h3> Multimedia </h3>
        <p> Freshman: At this time I was not at Cottonwood. AISU was closing, and a BIG time during that was me playing Magic the Gathering. So I looked through my decks for a fitting card. And I found a joke card that would represent the future, but for then, it was just a card.
        <br> Sophmore: 30 minutes. I made this in 30 minutes. I learned some aspects of blender in 30 minutes. Basically, I took planes, textured them, and then put them around. Pretty basic, but I was going to add a clothes pile. Never got to do that, ran out of time.
        <br> Junior: So I had to draw this with my mouse. I never installed drivers for my Wacom Tablet on my new SSD. Did you notice the hand in the top left? I thought that was a nice detail.
        <br> Senior: At this time I have YET to make anything for this! Wahhey! I have run out of art forms ALREADY! AHAHAHAHAHAHA!
