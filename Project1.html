    <h2> Evaluation of this piece </h2>
    <p> So far, at least, I feel like I have done an okay job.<br>HOWEVER!<br>This is still not finished. I have only done the first couple pages of what could very well be a light novel. Who knows? Maybe it is a light novel by now!</p>
    <h3> Details </h3>
    <p>I just realized how HARD it is to include as much detail as possible. I had a really hard time trying to describe things-- er, well-- I HAVE a really hard time trying to describe things. Details just don't properly go through my brain, and it makes my writing suffer. <br> I do honestly want to put you in a world, but all I can do is make you go through a quick dream sequence.</p>
    <h3> Figuarive Language </h3>
    <p>I don't think I have any figurative language. Probably only in one line I have something. Everything is pretty literal.</p>
    <h3>Point of View </h3>
    <p>FIRST PERSON! I could try to write in third person, but GOD I struggle with it. I have multiple characters, so I do have multiple POVs (well, at least for this bit. Everything will probably be in the main character's POV from now on) but I digress.<br> I feel like with third person I also wouldn't be able to give my main character... well, character! I feel like it would be really hard to just bring a character to life just through them talking. They need quips and thoughts. Their actions also matter, even if I can't think of them in the moment</p>
